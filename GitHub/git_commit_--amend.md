# Commit Amend

`git commit --amend` allows us to amend the previous commit instead of creating a brand you commit, keeping every commit specific and succinct. 

As this actually creates a whole new commit to replace the old one, it also requires a brand new commit message. If the we want to keep the orginial commit message, we can just use `git commit --amend --no-edit`
