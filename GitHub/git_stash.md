# Git Stash

`git stash` allows us to stash local work temporarily in order to switch branches to work on something else, while being able to retrieve the stashed work  later

`git stash list` wil show the list of stashed files

`git stah pop` retreives the stashed files so we can work fro mwhere we left off
