# HTML Forms

 A HTML form is used to allow users to input information and send it. A Html form is held within the following tags:
 ```
 <form>
 </form>
 ```
 
The `action` attribute determines where the information goes once it is submitted:
```
<form action="./example.html" method="POST">
</form>
```

There are various input types. It is good practice to label each input, and make reference to the input's id:
```
<label for="inputOne">This is the lable for inout one</label>
```
