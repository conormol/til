# The Ternary Operator 

The Ternary Operator (?) is shorthand for if/else statements
```
let x = 1;
```
```
if x === 1 {
  console.log('x is equal to 1');
  } else {
  console.log('x is not equal to 1');
  }
```

This can be written in shorthand as:
 ```
 x === 1 ? console.log('x is equal to 1') : console.log('x is not equal to 1');
 ```
