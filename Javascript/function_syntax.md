# Function Syntax in Javascript

Functions are written in the following format in Javascript:

```
function identifier() {
  --Task--
  }
```

For example
```
function greetworld() {
  console.log(Hello World!);
  }
```

In the above example, the function keyword is followed by the function identifier(greetworld) and a set of brackets, followed by the specific function task of printing Hello World, inside curly brackets
