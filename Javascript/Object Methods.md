# Object Methods

A function stored within an object is called a method. Syntax:

```

let myObject = {
  methodOne () {
    console.log("This is method one")
    },
  methodTwo () {
    console.log("This is method two")
    },  
 }
 
 ```
 
 object methods are called using the dot operator: ``myObject.methodOne()``
