# Object Methods

A function stored within an object is called a method. Syntax:

```

let myObject = {
    methodOne () {
      return "This is method one"
      },
    methodTwo () {
      return "This is method two"
      },  
   }

 
 ```
 
 object methods are called using the dot operator: ``myObject.methodOne()``
