# While Loops

## While

`while` Loops allow for non-numerical stopping conditions. Syntax is:

``
while x <= y {
  //Perform Action
  x++ //Or some method of iterating through various values of x
}
``

## Do While

`do while` loops run code at least once and only check the stopping condition after the first execution.

``
do {
  //Perform Action
  x++ //Or some method of iterating through various values of x
} while x <= y;
``
