flex-direction specifies how flex items are placed within a container, either vertically or horizintally, and determines whether they are placed in normal or reversed order. Flex-direction can read in one of four properties:
```
flex-direction: row;
```
```
flex-direction: row-reverse;
```
```
flex-direction: column;
```
```
flex-direction: column-reverse;
```
