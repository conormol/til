# Flex-Wrap

Determines whether or not flex items will jump to a new line when space is limited. Items will only begin to wrap if the flex-basis of the combined items is greater than the size of the parent container. Flex-wrap can read in one of three values:
```
flex-wrap: wrap;
```
```
flex-wrap: nowrap;
```
```
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
```
