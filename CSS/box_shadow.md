# Box Shadow

Creates a shadow on the outside or inside of the background of an element. 

syntax is as follows:
 ```
 box-shadow: none|h-offset v-offset blur spread color |inset|initial|inherit;
 ```
 For example:
 ```
  box-shadow: 0px 1px  #333 inset;
```

By default, the shadow is on the outside, and the 'inset' attribute is used to change it to the outside.
Blur and spread are optional vales.
