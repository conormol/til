# Justify Content

Justify Content in the context of a grid is used to position the entire griod along the row axis of a container. It reads in the same values as it would in the context of a flex-box:

`justify-content: start;`

`justify-content: end;`

`justify-content: center;`

`justify-content: space-around;`

`justify-content: space-between;`

`justify-content: stretch;`
