# Justify-items

The justify-items property is used on a grid container to determine how items are spread out along a row, by setting the default `justify-self` property for all child boxes. `justify-items` reads in the same property for a grid as it does for a flex box:

`justify-items: start`
`justify-items: end`
`justify-items: center`
`justify-items: space-around`
`justify-items: space-between`
