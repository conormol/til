# Media Queries

Media queries are used within CSS to adapt a website's content to various screen sizes. For the purposes of creating content responsive to screen size:

```
@media only screen and (max-width: 1200px) and (min-width: 300px), (orientation: portrait) {
      ....
      }
```

 ## @media
 - begins a media query rule

## only screen
- determines that the media rule applies to screens

## and
- The operator to add conditions to the rule

## ,
- the comma seperator allows the addition of conditions so that the rule can be satisfied if one of the conditions are met
