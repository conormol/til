To add a linear colour gradient to the background of an area

```
background: linear-gradient (rgb(x1, y1, z1), rgb(x2, y2, z2));
```

The gradient is written top to bottom, i.e the first colour is at the top and the final colour is at the bottom.

Note that most elements using this feature (buttons, banners etc.) look best when the gradient is light to dark from top to bottom respectively
